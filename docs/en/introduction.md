# Introduction

Welcome to hono-filebased-route, a powerful file-based routing system built on top of the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) web framework.

## What is hono-filebased-route?

hono-filebased-route brings the simplicity and convention of file-based routing to Hono applications. Inspired by frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js, it allows you to create API routes by simply organizing your files in a specific directory structure.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Automatic Route Generation**
No need to manually define routes. Just create files in your routes directory, and they automatically become accessible endpoints.

### üìÅ **Intuitive File Structure**
Your file system becomes your routing system. The directory structure directly maps to your URL structure.

### üîÑ **Dynamic Routes**
Support for dynamic parameters using bracket notation (`[id].ts`) and wildcard routes (`[...slug].ts`).

### üõ°Ô∏è **TypeScript First**
Built with TypeScript from the ground up, providing excellent type safety and developer experience.

### ‚ö° **Bun Optimized**
Optimized for Bun runtime while maintaining compatibility with Node.js.

### üîß **Flexible Configuration**
Customizable routing behavior with various configuration options.

## How It Works

The magic happens through a simple process:

1. **File Scanning**: The system scans your routes directory
2. **Path Conversion**: File paths are converted to URL patterns
3. **Route Registration**: Routes are automatically registered with your Hono app
4. **HTTP Method Mapping**: Exported functions (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) become route handlers

    H[routes/blog/[...slug].ts] --> I[/blog/*]
```

## Routing Patterns

### Static Routes
```
routes/about.ts ‚Üí /about
routes/contact.ts ‚Üí /contact
```

### Dynamic Routes
```
routes/users/[id].ts ‚Üí /users/:id
routes/posts/[slug].ts ‚Üí /posts/:slug
```

### Nested Routes
```
routes/api/users/index.ts ‚Üí /api/users
routes/api/users/[id].ts ‚Üí /api/users/:id
```

### Wildcard Routes
```
routes/blog/[...slug].ts ‚Üí /blog/*
routes/docs/[...path].ts ‚Üí /docs/*
```
